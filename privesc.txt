"find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null" to search the file system for SUID/GUID files.  

locate command = find files and folders

sudo -l = to see possible sudo commands

if we can run usr/bin/perl as sudo we can ----- sudo perl -e 'exec "bin//sh",'



## Privilege escalation

### [](https://github.com/dustypioneer/pentest_plus/tree/master/attacks_and_exploits/3.5#linux-specific)Linux-specific

- SUID/SGID programs (Set User ID, Set Group ID) - Crashing out of a program that runs as an elevated user may give an elevated prompt
- Unsecure SUDO - Authorized users execute commands as if root
- Ret2libc - stack overflow attack. Replaces current stack return address with attacker-chosen address of another subroutine. Libc includes useful calls, such as 'system'.
- Sticky bits - Directory permission which sets a permission that allows multiple users to create, read, and write files & executables but only the owner can delete them.

### [](https://github.com/dustypioneer/pentest_plus/tree/master/attacks_and_exploits/3.5#windows-specific)Windows-specific

- Cpassword - Group policy preference attribute that contains passwords. SYSVOL folder of the domain controller (encrypted XML)
- Clear text credentials in LDAP
- Kerberoasting - Domain users that can query Kerberos tickets for other users.
- Credentials in LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) - Enforces security policy
- Unattended installation - PXE (Preboot Execution Environment) may contain credentials
- SAM database (Security Account Manager) - Database that contains user passwords
- DLL hijacking (Dynamic Link Library) - Forcing a loader to load a malicious DLL

### [](https://github.com/dustypioneer/pentest_plus/tree/master/attacks_and_exploits/3.5#exploitable-services)Exploitable services

- Unquoted service paths - Allows abbreviated attack paths without spaces. IE "C:\Program Files" vs C:\Program\Files
- Writable services - The ability to write and change the path to the service
- Unsecure file/folder permissions - Allowing read/write by non root users
- Keylogger - records every keystroke.
- Scheduled tasks - Attacker may add tasks which run with elevated privlidges.
- Kernel exploits

## [](https://github.com/dustypioneer/pentest_plus/tree/master/attacks_and_exploits/3.5#default-account-settings)Default account settings

Defaults should be disabled or renamed. Default passwords should always be changed.

## [](https://github.com/dustypioneer/pentest_plus/tree/master/attacks_and_exploits/3.5#sandbox-escape)Sandbox escape

- Shell upgrade - gaining access to a shell on the host system, with root privliges.
- VM - Virtual Machine
- Container

## [](https://github.com/dustypioneer/pentest_plus/tree/master/attacks_and_exploits/3.5#physical-device-security)Physical device security

- Cold boot attack - Rebooting a system and launching a different OS may allow access to things such as encryption keys or password databases.
- JTAG debug - (Joint Test Action Group) - Allows for attackers to debug hardware. Industry standard for debugging circuit boards.
- Serial console - Direct access to servers and network gear.
